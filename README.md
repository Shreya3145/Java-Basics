# Java Basics Repository ☕️

Welcome to my Java Basics Repository! This repository contains a collection of basic-level Java programs that I have developed for personal problem-solving and skill enhancement.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice fundamental Java programming concepts.
- Solve small coding problems and exercises.
- Maintain a record of my learning journey in Java.
- Build a portfolio of simple Java projects.

## Contents
The repository is organized into directories based on the type of problem or concept. Some of the key categories include:
- **Algorithms** – Basic algorithms like sorting, searching, etc.
- **Data Structures** – Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** – Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation examples.
- **Utility Programs** – Small utility scripts to solve everyday problems.
- **Java Basics** – Programs covering loops, conditionals, arrays, and other core Java features.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired program directory.
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java ProgramName
   ```

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Version 11 or higher recommended).
